Testing out blockchain concepts and cryptography

Student project following a general blockchain guide created to better understand just what a blockchain even is

Currently using the hashcash algorithm and following the structure of bitcoin

Very early stages of development currently, just has a working RedisDB and the actual blockchain and cryptography components completed, currently need to add networking (p2p), the ability to conduct transaction, and maybe change it from mimicking bitcoin to doing its own unique thing.
